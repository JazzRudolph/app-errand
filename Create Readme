# Being Productive
Jazz Rudolph

My project is a react errand app web site, the purpose of this errandâ€™s app is to sort your daily errands into a list so that you 
organize your day and get the most out of your day. Most adults work five days a week with only two days off to get everything 
in their personal lives done, so with this app, you will be able to put your errands and the amount of time you want to take to 
accomplish each errand.


Another way to interact with this app is with the actions on the right side of each task. You will be able to delete individual 
tasks, mark them as complete or clear them if marked complete by accident, and lastly move them up and down the list in order of
importance or which errands you want to tackle first. 

The time and date have also been included in the app, so you are able to track how much time you've spent on a task and if a task 
can be pushed back to another date.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I also used Google Fonts, Font Awesome, and a very small amount of Bootstrap.

Future improvements will consist of a more appealing form on my page, 
adding additional features to my app such as setting the importance of each task and possibly color-coding them,
and lastly linking the app to other devices so you can work between cellphones/tablets/computers.
