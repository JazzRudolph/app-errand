# Being Productive
Jazz Rudolph

My project is a react errand app web site, the purpose of this errandâ€™s app is to sort your daily errands into a list so that you 
organize your day and get the most out of your day. Most adults work five days a week with only two days off to get everything 
in their personal lives done, so with this app, you will be able to put your errands and the amount of time you want to take to 
accomplish each errand.


Another way to interact with this app is with the actions on the right side of each task. You will be able to delete individual 
tasks, mark them as complete or clear them if marked complete by accident, and lastly move them up and down the list in order of
importance or which errands you want to tackle first. 

The time and date have also been included in the app, so you are able to track how much time you've spent on a task and if a task 
can be pushed back to another date.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I also used Google Fonts, Font Awesome, and a very small amount of Bootstrap.

Future improvements will consist of a more appealing form on my page, 
adding additional features to my app such as setting the importance of each task and possibly color-coding them,
and lastly linking the app to other devices so you can work between cellphones/tablets/computers.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
